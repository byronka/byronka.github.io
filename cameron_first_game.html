              Milo said to Tock as he bent down to scratch the dog's ear.
              "Only when you use a lot to say a little," answered Tock.
              Milo thought this was quite the wisest thing he'd heard all
              day.

    Cameron's first game.

  Had to wake up at 6:30am to make breakfast, found out he didn't
  like oatmeal.  Oh well.  Game started, volunteer parents in
  their spots - scoreboard, music, etc.  Some of the parents watching
  were too intense.  Screaming at the referees, that kind of
  thing.  I guess a bunch of them have high hopes for their kids, or
  maybe just into sports.

  Our team was missing their goalie, and to compensate we
  were allowed to have an extra player in play, but no goalie meant
  that the other team was able to take shots on the goal from the
  other side of the rink and make it.  Lost the game, 2-4.  Cameron
  got some play time.

  One of the kids did or said something from the bench that caused a
  penalty against their team.  Because of that, the coach had to pick
  someone to pay off the penalty in the penalty box.  Cameron had the
  honor of taking one for the team.  Here he is in jail.

  Because Cameron is very new to the team and the game of hockey, the
  coach had him on the bench a lot.  Nonetheless, he's picking up a
  lot - the rules of the game, and so on.
