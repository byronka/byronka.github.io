  Right? My new pet peeve.
<p>
  <div class="date">July 29, 2014</div>
<p class="content-body">

  Have you heard people use "right?" as a <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discourse_particle">discourse
  particle</a>?  What am I supposed to do? A deep, real-time  analysis of their
  ongoing argument? 

</p>  
<p class="content-body">

  I cannot keep up.  Other people ignore it.  But when we let people use
  "Right?" throughout their speech, we are implicitly agreeing with them.  At
  the very least, by saying "Right?" so much, it seems like they are
  rhetorically implying they are correct, when in fact it is likely there are
  errors in their argument.

</p>
<p class="content-body">
  Maybe I should respond to them every time they say "right?" like they are
  asking a question.  And since I like being truthful, I will answer every
  time with "I don't know".  I hate rhetorical questions.
