            <p class="quote">"I never knew words could be so confusing,"
              Milo said to Tock as he bent down to scratch the dog's ear.
              "Only when you use a lot to say a little," answered Tock.
              Milo thought this was quite the wisest thing he'd heard all
              day.

	Using <b>this</b> in JavaScript - reasons not to use it.

<p class="content-body">
<ol class="content-body">
<li> when outside a function, "this" means the global object.</li>

<li> inside a function [not attached to an object, that is, f2() rather than bob.f2() ]:
<ul>
	<li>normal mode:
		it has to be set to something by the call, but if not, it will default to Window.
		</li>
	<li>strict mode:
		if you run "use strict" in the function, it will remain undefined if you don't set it.
		However, some browsers don't implement strict mode correctly - here is the chart: http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es5/#Strict_mode
		</li>
		</ul>
		
<li> as a method [ attached to an object, like bob.f2() rather than f2() ]:
<ul>
<li>
	"this" gets set to the object that the method is attached to.
</li>
<li>
	beware: this behavior happens merely by calling the method off an object.  You may have declared it independently or not.
</li>
<li>
	beware: "this" will be the most immediate object.  Parent objects won't matter.</li>
</li>
</ul>

<li> on the object's prototype chain:
	just like as a method, it will set "this" to whatever object it gets called off.  which means that if you expected
	"this" to be bob, it may not be.
  <pre><code class="language-javascript">
	bob = {};
	bob.runme = function () { return this };
	
	bobson = Object.create(bob);
	bobson.name = "Hi I am Bob's son!";
	bobson.runme();
	
	</code></pre>
	</li>
<li> on a constructor:
	"this" is the new object being constructed.
	if you return a new object at the end of the constructor, *that* object gets returned instead of the object being constructed.
		therefore, after new'ing up the object, you stand the possibility of not seeing what you expect:
		<pre><code class="language-javascript">function C2() {this.a = 26;return {b:15};}
>undefined
var o = new C2();
>undefined
o.a
>undefined
o.b
>15
</code></pre>
</li>
<li> in "call" and "apply": you can set what "this" should be.</li>

<li> as an event handler: "this" will be set to the element the event fired from, (though some browsers vary if not using addEventListener)</li>

<li> in-line event handler:
	"this" is set to the DOM element, but only if it's not inside a function.  If inside a function, it will get set to Window.</li>
	</ol></p>
