              "Only when you use a lot to say a little," answered Tock.
              Milo thought this was quite the wisest thing he'd heard all
              day.

    Otherwise

		I was thinking of a a new syntactic sugar:  "Otherwise".  It would
allow this situation: In a method, we want to run through some lines
of code, testing predicates and running code as we go, with the
stipulation that it should be possible that one or more of the
predicates are valid, and the code should be able to run any of the
valid branches.  This can't be done with if-else's, since in those
cases only one of the branches get run.  And switch() won't work
because it isn't built to allow one *or more* of the branches to be
followed. At the end of the method, we want to run some code if the
preceeding stuff never ran, that is, if all the preceeding predicates
were false. 

  </p>

	<p class="content-body">
For example, if A is true, run the A command, if B is true, run the B
command, if C is true, run the C command, if none of those were true,
run the D command.
	</p>

	<pre><code class="language-c"
>method () {             method () {
  temp_flag=false        <
  if A:                     if A:
    temp_flag=true       <   
    A_command()                 A_command()
  if B:                     if B:
    temp_flag=true       <   
    B_command()                B_command()
  if C:                     if C:
    temp_flag=true       <   
    C_command()                C_command()
  if (temp_flag=false):  |   otherwise:
    D_command()                  D_command()
}                           }</code></pre>
<p class="content-body">
  We carry along information on whether all of the
	previous "if" statements were false.  If they were, we
	can go into the "otherwise" statement.
</p>
<p class="content-body">
we can use short-cicuit evaluation to benefit here.  What that means
is that as soon as some particular piece of logic is definite and
further evaluation is redundant, the computer stops processing it.
</p>
<p class="content-body">
For our situation, the following code would suffice, although it is not as
expressive. We want short-circuiting, so we want the first part (the
part containing the first three functions) to cause us to skip
"otherwise".  In an AND operator, if the first element is false then
we can skip evaluation of subsequent logic.  So we have to figure out
how to make the first part evaluate to false if any one of the first
three functions returns true.
</p>
	<pre><code class="language-c"
>!(A() || B() || C()) 
	&& otherwise()
</code></pre>
<p class="content-body">
	Given a method definition like:
	<pre><code class="language-c"
>A() {
	if a_makes_sense:
		go_on_a_walk();
		return true;
	else
		return false;
}
</code></pre>
