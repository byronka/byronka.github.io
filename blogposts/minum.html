		A minimalistic Java web framework
	<p>
	<div class="date">November 4, 2023</div>
	<p class="content-body">
	I have published a stable Java web framework focusing on minimalism.
	</p>

	<p class="content-body">
	You will be hard-pressed to find a modern web framework as
	single-mindedly focused on minimalism, simplicity, and
	ease-of-use.
	</p>

	<p class="content-body">
	The first question I get asked about this is: "Why would I use
	this? What differentiates it from the many other web
	frameworks available?"
	</p>

	<p class="content-body">
	This is a framework intended for the rare individual starving
	for minimalism in a baroque world. Conventional frameworks,
	like Spring Boot, put high guardrails around capabilities.
	They embrace a paradigm of building blocks (e.g.
	"Transactional").  Most of the whirring parts are safely
	hidden away.
	</p>

	<p class="content-body">
	These guardrails require a large amount of code, which
	increases the complexity.  New concepts require reading
	copious documentation on each building block.  It also makes
	maintenance harder, since stacktraces will be made nearly
	useless by the hidden machinery.  More code means more to
	read, which hinders deep understanding.  It means there is
	more surface area for bugs to manifest.
	</p>

	<p class="content-body">
	In contrast, the Minum project follows the self-imposed
	constraint that smaller and lighter is better.  Being an
	advocate for software quality, I built a system replete with
	automated testing, documentation, code invariants, and
	examples.
	</p>

	<p class="content-body">
	This is not for everyone, and I have no illusion 
	that this will get very popular.  It is an experiment, and
	caters to an unusual taste.
	</p>


	<p class="content-body">
	The goals of this software are to provide excellence in:
	</p>

	<p class="content-body">
	<ul>
		<li>Minimalism</li>
		<li>Ease of use</li>
		<li>Maintainability</li>
		<li>Debuggability</li>
		<li>Performance</li>
		<li>Documentation</li>
		<li>Testing</li>
	</ul>

	It requires Java 21, for its virtual threads.
