<p class="content-body">
I keep reading essays (see notes below) how simplicity should be favored over
complexity.  That microservices and Kubernetes are overkill for most projects.
Why embrace undue complexity needlessly, why not keep things simple?
</p>

<p class="content-body">
In 2018, I needed some software for demonstrating the industry's best
practices for students.  Our company's existing demo software was
insufficient to teach from, which drove me to build a <a
href="https://github.com/7ep/demo">new project</a>, a Java web 
application simple enough to avoid confusing students.  This turned out
to be an incredible opportunity to play with many prominent
quality engineering ideas and tools. Although I had
been a practitioner for years at that point, this was a pivot to
focusing on quality from theoretical first principles.
</p>

<p class="content-body">
Around 2020, I procured time from my company to work with colleagues
on a project to explore better process. The result was this <a href="https://github.com/7ep/r3z">timekeeping web application from scratch</a>,
written in Kotlin with zero runtime dependencies.
</p>

<p class="content-body">
Afterwards, my colleague Matt suggested that it would be valuable for
the generally useful code to be split out to its own project.  The
common parts were components like the web server, the utilities, the
database, and other aspects.
</p>

<p class="content-body">
That program, a Java web framework called <a href="https://github.com/byronka/minum">Minum</a>, began development in
December of 2021. Great emphasis was placed on avoiding cleverness and
embracing simplicity as the guiding star.  Version one was released almost a year
ago, and the project has entered a state of stability.  The focus is providing
a zero-dependency web framework for developers of monolithic, server-side-rendered web
applications.  In some ways, this project is a rebuke of the prevalence of
microservices complexity-oriented approaches.
</p>

<p class="content-body">
I have recently added a <a href="https://github.com/byronka/minum/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">guide on making contributions</a> to the project,
if any of this piqued your interest.  I would certainly value the
insight of other practitioners.
