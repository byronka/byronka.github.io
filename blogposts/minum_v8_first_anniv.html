		First year anniversary of Minum version 8
	<p>
	<div class="date">August 17, 2025</div>

	<p class="content-body">It has been a year since the last
	major version change on <a href="https://github.com/byronka/minum.git">Minum</a>, so I wanted to provide an
	update.</p>

	<p class="content-body">I needed Minum to exist.  Nothing else
	came close. I needed a framework that was the smallest,
	simplest, stablest, least-powerful, least-magical, and
	best-tested.</p>

	<p class="content-body">Most others touted their minimalism,
	but were comprised of tremendous quantities of code.  Most
	others mentioned simplicity, but a quick inspection showed a
	labyrinth.  Most frameworks relentlessly added new
	features.</p>

	<p class="content-body">When I started out as a new developer,
	we used Microsoft Web Forms.  A charitable description might
	be that it made building web applications as straightforward
	as for desktop.  However, there was hardly time between
	starting out and finding oneself in a quicksand of complexity.
	It soon became necessary to customize things beyond what the
	UI builder could provide.</p>

	<p class="content-body">Subsequent teams and technologies followed a
	similar track.  Unnecessary complexity, in support of the notion of
	less-capable programmers.  The strictures and magic of those frameworks
	hindered me.  In fact, I found that most of my colleagues were indeed
	highly capable, but there is a ramp-up time on any new technology where
	some clumsy errors are made.  Eventually though, that phase is left
	behind and the team develops sophistication.</p>

	<p class="content-body">Unfortunately, the system remained as
	it was designed, meant for unsophisticated developers.  The
	pain it caused was particularly acute during the maintenance
	phase.  At that point, the framework's apparatus, whose intent
	was ease of development, only obscured the data flow.</p>

	<p class="content-body">Popular tools often describe
	themselves along the lines of "making it easy to do complex
	things".  This is not possible; our medium is complexity
	itself.  While one technology might be simpler than another,
	that nuanced viewpoint gets short shrift.  Our work will
	always be difficult, and never more than when attempting to
	fix a bug without adding a new one. Like Kernighan's Law:

	<blockquote>
	Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first
	place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as
	possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug
	it.
        </blockquote>

	</p>

	<p class="content-body">The cure is to build with the
	least-powerful tools possible, in the least-clever way, even
	if that makes our initial work harder.</p>

	<p class="content-body">While every program has bugs, there
	are bright lights shining on every piece of Minum's code in
	the form of test and documentation.  Additionally, there is a
	production system exercising every feature, which helps to
	highlight anything unexpected (particularly related to
	attacks)</p>

	<p class="content-body">Minum has remained stable in its major
	features and has not had breaking changes in a year.  The
	intention is to stay that way for the future.  There is no
	planned end-of-life for <a href="https://github.com/byronka/minum.git">Minum</a> version 8.</p>
