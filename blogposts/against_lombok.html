		Against Lombok
	<p>
		<div class="date">May 31, 2025</div>

	<p class="content-body">
	There are two small but definite reasons why I dislike Lombok:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Hidden code doesn't provide me any benefits.</li>
		<li>Having to be aware of implicit behavior surprises.</li>
	</ul>

	<p class="content-body">
	In the programming industry, it often seems like people gets
	sold on an idea but forget the reasons later. Then the idea
	ends up persisting on momentum.  I think that on the whole,
	Lombok is a net detriment.  Not a huge one, but sufficiently a
	drawback that I would never choose it on my own.
	</p>

	<p class="content-body">
	The two reasons why are listed at the top.  Let me explain my
	viewpoint.
	</p>

	<p class="content-body">
	Why would hiding code with annotations be a net positive?
	Well-written code provides clarity, opportunities for
	documentation, and is expected to be there.  For it to be
	missing? I don't know, it seems like the premise is somehow
	implied to be that hidden code is an intrinsic good.  It
	doesn't compute with me.
	</p>

	<p class="content-body">
	Now, I can imagine a more persuasive argument; that the
	benefit is to avoid *typing* the code in the first place.
	But, countering that, most serious programming editors will
	generate the code you need, obviating that argument.
	</p>

	<p class="content-body">
	Now on to the second point - implicit behavior surprises.  Did you know
	that the Lombok-generated constructor, which isn't visible, will
	arrange its parameters based on the order of properties in the class?
	That's just one of a bunch of surprising behaviors that a Lombok user
	must be aware of.  I just don't see the value.
	</p>

	<p class="content-body"> 
	I like things plain and obvious, and choosing Lombok is a vote for
	magic surprising behaviors.  No thanks. If I have any choice in the
	matter, I won't have Lombok anywhere in my code.
	</p>

	<p class="content-body">
	There are other drawbacks: Conflicts with other annotation
	processors.  Having yet another dependency.  Being slowed down
	from adopting the latest Java versions.  Relying on a tool
	whose paradigm conflicts with Java's. Code navigability may be
	harmed.  Requires extra configuration of IDE's.
	</p>

	<p class="content-body">
	Here is another author describing his complaints about Lombok,
	with some overlaps on mine:
