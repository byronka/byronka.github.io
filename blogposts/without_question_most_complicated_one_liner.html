  Without doubt, the most complex shell one-liner I have done
  </p>
  <div class="date">August 25, 2018</div>
  <p class="content-body">
  I was putting some photos on my website and created this insanely
  complex one-liner without even really intending to.  It's an aspect
  of the Unix shell philosophy to incrementally build up greater and
  greater complexity on a line until it does what you want.  Often,
  that consists of incrementally building a string that will be run or
  added to a file.  In this particular case, I wanted to add photos to
  my website, and I wanted to automate the generation of html.  So
  what did I do?  I looped through all the photo files, adding the
  name of each one into a script that generated the necessary html
  text, and then added those lines to my webpage, in this case
  "photos.html"
  </p>
  <p class="content-body">
<pre class="language-bash"
>for i in /var/www/photos/1/*; do echo "&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"$(echo $i|sed 's:/var/www/::g')\"&gt;$(echo $i|sed 's:/var/www/photos/1/::g')&lt;/a&gt;" &gt;&gt; ../renomadwebsite/photos.html; echo "&lt;p&gt;$(identify -verbose $i|grep ImageDescription|sed 's/^.*exif:ImageDescription: //g')&lt;/p&gt;" &gt;&gt; ../renomadwebsite/photos.html; done 
</pre>
  </p>
  <p class="content-body">
  Let's step through this. First, I'll break it down a little - a for
  loop with two lines.  At this point we can see that we loop through
  all the files in a directory, and run two commands on them.  To help
  you better understand, the first line creates html to refer to a
  photo, and the second line uses a command from ImageMagick called
  "Identify" to pull out text information from the photo.
  </p>
<pre
>for i in /var/www/photos/1/*
  do 
    echo "&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"$(echo $i|sed 's:/var/www/::g')\"&gt;$(echo $i|sed 's:/var/www/photos/1/::g')&lt;/a&gt;" &gt;&gt; ../renomadwebsite/photos.html
    echo "&lt;p&gt;$(identify -verbose $i|grep ImageDescription|sed 's/^.*exif:ImageDescription: //g')&lt;/p&gt;" &gt;&gt; ../renomadwebsite/photos.html
  done 
</pre>
  <p class="content-body">
  Let's take apart the first line.  The one unusual thing going on is
  that I have nested commands using the $() shell operator.  You can
  see that I am setting up a hyperlink starting at <em>href=</em>.
  But then you see I have some commands inside the parentheses.  What
  I am doing there is using the <em>sed</em> command to replace the
  path information on the file with an empty string, so it has the
  exactly correct syntax.  I do a very similar thing a little further
  on, where I remove the entire path and leave only the file name.  At
  the end of the line, I append the output to the photos.html file.
  Getting ahead a little bit, I do a very similar thing in the next
  line.
  </p>
<pre
>echo "&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"$(echo $i|sed 's:/var/www/::g')\"&gt;$(echo $i|sed 's:/var/www/photos/1/::g')&lt;/a&gt;" &gt;&gt; ../renomadwebsite/photos.html
</pre>
  <p class="content-body">
  I should emphasize that this isn't meant to represent a finished and
  general program.  It's a one-off artifact that gets thrown away at
  the end.  In Unix, you use the tools available to build the things
  you need.  Certainly, it's possible to build this out into something
  more generally usable, but then you lose flexibility.  It's like the
  difference between having a workshop full of tools and a
  do-it-all-machine.  When you know how to use the tools, you can do
  anything.  The do-it-all-machine, on the other hand, is wonky and
  doesn't always do it just how you wanted, and is hard to fathom and
  fix.
